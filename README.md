## DFG: Feature Selection via Dynamic Feature Graph

This repository provides a python implementation of DFG as described in the paper ["Feature Selection via Dynamic Feature Graph"](https://).

## Datasets
The datasets are accessible through the UCI machine learning repository (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.php) or scikit-feature selection repository (https://jundongl.github.io/scikit-feature/datasets.html).

## Environment Settings
- numpy
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- scipy
- pandas
